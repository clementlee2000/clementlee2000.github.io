<p>In the blink of an eye a month has passed. I‚Äôm happy to report that the stickered drawer sides stayed flat! I was particularly concerned with this board that displayed a ‚Äúcathedral‚Äù grain pattern on its face - these boards tend to cup. If you look at the end grain (think round cross section of a tree trunk, the view from which you would count growth rings), you can imagine the board as a rectanglular slice that was extracted from a set of concentric circles, and it should be obvious why these boards tend to cup.</p>

<h3 id="cutting-the-bottom-groove">Cutting the bottom groove</h3>

<p>I lied when I said in the last post that the boards were ready for handwork. I actually decided to cut in the grooves (called dados in woodworking land) to hold the drawer bottoms. It‚Äôs a straightforward process: I went through all my boards to pick out the orientation (i.e. which side should be inside and which side should be the top). Then I set my tablesaw fence at 1/4‚Äù and made a first pass on the inside bottom of all the boards. There is something satisfying in brainlessly batching out work‚Ä¶</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important to use a flat top grind sawblade for cutting dados, otherwise the bottom will be uneven and your cut will have what‚Äôs affectionately known as ‚Äòbat ears‚Äô. My blade is regular thickness at 1/8‚Äù, and I‚Äôm using 1/4‚Äù drawer bottoms which typically has an actual thicnkess of 7/32‚Äù or 6 mm depending on the source. Regardless, one pass of my sawblade is not wide enough, so I nudged the fence a little and took a second pass on all the boards. Of course before making this cut on all the sides its important to first dial in the fence position such that the dado will accept the drawer bottom easily without being too loose.</p>

<p>So satistifying when you nail the fit. I had an offcut piece from the material I‚Äôll be using as the drawer bottoms so it made testing for fit easier. Alternatively, I could‚Äôve tested the drawer side on the 8‚Äô sheet‚Ä¶</p>

<p>By the way, those boards at the bottom are pieces of cherry, which will also be used for this dresser. I guess you could say that it‚Äôs the cherry at the bottom. Thanks for reading!</p>
