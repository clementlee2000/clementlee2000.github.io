<p>In the blink of an eye a month has passed. I‚Äôm happy to report that the stickered drawer sides stayed flat! I was particularly concerned with this board that displayed a ‚Äúcathedral‚Äù grain pattern on its face - these boards tend to cup. If you look at the end grain (think round cross section of a tree trunk, the view from which you would count growth rings), you can imagine the board as a rectanglular slice that was extracted from a set of concentric circles, and it should be obvious why such a board may cup.</p>

### Cutting the bottom groove

I lied when I mentioned that the boards were ready for hand work on the last post. I actually decided to cut in the grooves (called dados in woodworking land) to hold the drawer bottoms. It's a straightforward process: I went through all my boards to pick out the orientation (i.e. which side should be inside and which side should be the top). Then I set my tablesaw fence at 1/4" and made a first pass on the inside bottom of all the boards. There is something satisfying in brainlessly batching out work...

My table saw

Next I used my crosscut sled and cut two sides from each board, then the fronts and backs from each board. That way, I didn't have to keep measuring and readjusting between the boards. I did end up making a mistake when transitioning from cutting the sides: I cut out a front that was 1" shorter than the back! Thankfully I have a couple spare boards, so cutting a replacement was simple enough. If you don't make a mistake, did you really even do anything?

A crosscut sled is great at making square cuts; the little wedge shaped offcut is a mistake introduced by my freehanded circular saw cut from the beginning. A 1/4" mistake over a 7 3/4" board is significant and would have made putting this drawer together impossible.

So much saw dust. Maybe about 10x pictured was not captured by the vacuum I had connected to the saw. It's so fluffy, somehow I had a mental image of a miniature dog frolicking in it.


24 boards ready for hand work! I've also stickered the wood (i.e. stacked them with spacers) to allow for airflow. The idea is that after boards are cut, some tensions may be relieved and the moisture content also needs to reqeuilibrate. The airflow helps even drying / rehydration, minimizing any twists or cups. I'm not too worried, but it's good practice.

By the way, those boards at the bottom are pieces of cherry, which will also be used for this dresser. I guess you could say that it's the cherry at the bottom. Thanks for reading!
