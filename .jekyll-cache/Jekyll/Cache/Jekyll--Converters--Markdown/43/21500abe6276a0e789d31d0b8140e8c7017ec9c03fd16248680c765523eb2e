I"K<p>Christening my website with this <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/bookshelf-speakers/diy-overnightsensations">Overnight Sensations</a> build. These bookshelf speakers are famous for being a great first DIY build. A long time colleague and friend of mine is a real audiophile (<a href="https://gyree.co/scae-01-dicek/">see these speakers he designed and built</a>) and I finally caught the bug and decided to build a pair of my own. I purchased a kit online and worked on it over the course of a month. My ears are happy, I’m happy, and I hope you’re happy.</p>
